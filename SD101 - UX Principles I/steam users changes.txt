"Revolutionise the wishlist functionality: game discovery is fine, I'm falling over games I want to buy left and right, but no game platform provides a truly adequate system for evaluating, ranking, categorising, and making final purchase decisions on games once I've found them. This is the one thing I use external tools for: some I have found and others I have actually coded myself. For one example, it'd be really nice to  have a tool that picks a few games off your wishlist, the prices of which add up to less than your wallet balance, as a sort of ""suggested purchase"" - this is something I resort to doing with spreadsheets, which is not ideal.

Also itch.io needs a wallet balance and gift cards. Come on guys."

Improved speed of client to access the data I want faster, like reviews, shortcut buttons, low load times, just faster accessibility.

Steam UI cause holy sh*t is it outdated.

permanent 50% off all games

More frequently updated backgrounds and avatars available in points store

I think the ability to look through friends profile pages easier would be nice. also the ability to find random high rated games.

Be able to "rent" games for a time would be nice, instead of Buying and having 2 hours of play and getting a refund.
