On Steam, certain numbers are inconsistent across the UI. The number of games it reports in my library varies wildly across the different places you can find the number; the number of items on a wishlist includes delisted games (which require external tools to remove), but only in some places; and the number of reviews for games it counts is always lower than the actual number of reviews. Also, reviews on itch.up are practically useless because people are too nice, but this is an unsolvable problem. 

Steam has a load of options.... too many options. Also recommends some questionable content.

Interfaces that are pop-ups, or advertising sales, God that pisses me off. I already pay for the games, don't bloat me with pop-ups.

The extreme sheer amount of hentai games on steam

finding DLC, instead of just the bundles, from the games shop page

Steam almost exclusively shows games similar to those that you currently play meaning if you want to find a new game that is dissimilar to games you already play it can be quite a struggle.  

Sometimes on Steam I have difficulties locating my wish list or downloading games

The price of games... Usually wait for a sale.. Rent a game would be nice.
