I like how they are set up as well as the regular sales

At some point, about a couple years ago, everybody got really, really good at the game discovery algorithm. All I have to do is merely visit steam or itch.io while I'm logged in and I'm presented with a wealth of games I think I would really like to play. Though this for me may be becoming more of a curse than a blessing...

Honestly I just use it (Steam) out of habit, since I got it 19 years ago when I first bought Half Life 2 way back in 2003. Furthermore, nowadays I exclusively play on a Valve Index, so obviously on SteamVR.

GoG is DRM free, Epic Games pretty clean UI, Steam is well known and fairly easy to understand. 

steam is easy to use

Highly acclaimed games being more available, and indie games that are receiving praise. I prefer to play games at the cream of the crop, not flops.
clean and easy to access format

"Steam.
I am impressed by the sheer quantity of games you can find on the platform.
Being able to look for games through tags such as ""Free to Play"" or ""Puzzle""
the dark colours are nice as it means that at night the screen isn't too bright meaning i can dim the lights in the room without straining my eyes."

I like Steamâ€™s featured tab and search engine

I like how easily I can narrow down what I'm looking for. (Filters, Price, genre, age, ect...)

clean simple sharp UI is key
