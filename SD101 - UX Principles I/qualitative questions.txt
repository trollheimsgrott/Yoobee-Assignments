How easy was it to install the game?
Its relatively easy it was just right there (had mentioned you cant search by filters but in doing so found out that it is possible, but not obvious)

How easy was it to find RPG games until 20nzd ( filters )
not at all huge paint point - too many different pages / layouts / navigational structures

Any pain points?
client is diffent to webbrowser, navigation differs

Briar = 1

Do you have any pain points or successpoints in mind

Too much info on each pages, lack of clarity in the language  and layout, and priorities of the layout
I liked the design of the plain background, simple text, over saturated with foreground content

What do you think of the community hub?
Doesnt seem intuitive to navigate between or to certain forums (refinement / filters) . would be tempted to use google instead for help forums.

    What did you find easy?
        once found the filter were easy to use
        game search was easy

    Most frustrating thing? 
        Finlay. not being able to easily find the discussion forums
        install button remarked to be quite small and not visible enough

    What did you find easy?
        steam install easy

    Most frustrating thing? 
        dislikes category system, would prefer if when a genre is clicked within the category system, it applies it as a filter on all games
        seeing your library not very obvious, could be easier
        game store page should have a bigger/ more visible community button
